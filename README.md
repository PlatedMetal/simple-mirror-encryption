# simple-mirror-encryption
Simple encryption algorithm that mirrors letters across the keyboard, with the option to shift letters. Obviously not the most secure thing in the world, but it was the first thing I thought of when asked to create a cipher. The average person would probably take a while to figure it out without looking at the source code.
